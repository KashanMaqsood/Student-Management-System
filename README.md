## Introduction  
The **Student Management System** is a simple yet powerful **C++ application** that streamlines student record management. It eliminates the need for manual record-keeping, reduces errors, and provides a structured way to store and retrieve student details. With a focus on **efficiency, reliability, and data integrity**, this project showcases key programming concepts, including **file handling, object-oriented design, and input validation**.  

## Objectives  
- Develop an **efficient system** for managing student records.  
- Apply **object-oriented programming (OOP) principles**.  
- Implement **file handling** to ensure data persistence.  
- Enhance user experience with **a simple and interactive console interface**.  
- Ensure **input validation and error handling** for data accuracy.  

## Features  
- **Add Student** – Store student details (name, enrollment number, grades).  
- **Search Student** – Find a student by **enrollment number**.  
- **Update Student** – Modify existing student details.  
- **Delete Student** – Remove a student record from the system.  
- **Display All Students** – View all stored student records.  
- **Calculate Average Grade** – Compute the overall class performance.  
- **File Handling** – Save and retrieve student records for data persistence.  

## Methodology  
The development process follows these steps:  
1. **Requirement Analysis** – Identifying core functionalities.  
2. **System Design** – Using **OOP principles** (classes, objects, encapsulation).  
3. **Implementation** – Writing clean and modular C++ code.  
4. **Testing & Debugging** – Validating inputs and ensuring correct functionality.  
5. **Data Persistence** – Implementing file handling for storing student records.  
6. **Optimization & Finalization** – Enhancing efficiency and maintainability.  

## Outcomes  
- **Automated Record Management** – Reduces manual work and enhances efficiency.  
- **Robust Data Handling** – Uses **file storage** for data persistence.  
- **Improved Programming Skills** – Strengthened knowledge of **C++, OOP, and file handling**.  
- **Scalability & Modularity** – Designed for future enhancements like database integration.
